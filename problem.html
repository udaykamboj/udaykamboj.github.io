                        <p>Think about how much water  means in your life. You use it for self-care, washing dishes and clothes, using the bathroom, and much more. Now think about what your life would be like if you didn't have access to clean water. You wouldn't be able to have clean clothes, or dishes. It would be much harder to make food.  You would get lots of illnesses such as dysentery. This is the life about 2 billion people live, around 46% of the world's population.</p>

                        <h2>How did it Happen?</h2>
                        <p>There are several reasons as to why people don't have access to clean water, one of which is climate change. Climate change is making temperatures rise, which can disrupt the water cycle, making water harder to find in some parts of the world. Another reason for lack of water is populations growing. Recently, the population has been growing steadily at around 0.87%. This also increases the need for water. Every new person that is born needs water, and the more people there are the more the demand for water grows. They also need food which we use water to grow.

                    <div class="content-title style1">
                        <p>The final reason is because of  urban demand. With more people demanding water, the price for water is rising. The price has been increasing at about 1 cent per year. This disallows some of the poorer countries the ability to get water. This means that not only are the prices rising, but the demand is outstripping the supply, making it difficult for people who cannot afford to pay the higher prices to access clean water. This has resulted in a situation of water scarcity, whereby the poor are unable to access clean water due to the increasing cost and the inability to meet the demand. This has dire consequences for those in poverty, leading to further health issues and a decrease in quality of life.</p>

                  <div class="divider lg"></div>
                  <p>The Water is Wellness campaign was started by a group of 7th graders. Their goal is to make a difference in challenging times. For example, all because of inflation and rates rising, many people can't afford everything, so that makes them into poverty and then they can't access clean water. Our goal is to make sure that everyone has clean, pure water. Think about the people that are undernourished and sick all over the world without water. Thus, we want to make sure that everyone has access to pure water, a bare necessity to human life.</p>
