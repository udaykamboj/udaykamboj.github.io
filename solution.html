                  <div class="divider lg"></div>
                  <p>The Water is Wellness campaign was started by a group of 7th graders. Their goal is to make a difference in challenging times. For example, all because of inflation and rates rising, many people can't afford everything, so that makes them into poverty and then they can't access clean water. Our goal is to make sure that everyone has clean, pure water. Think about the people that are undernourished and sick all over the world without water. Thus, we want to make sure that everyone has access to pure water, a bare necessity to human life.</p>
