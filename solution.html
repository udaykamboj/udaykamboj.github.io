                           <li><b>Delivery.</b> In some places in, people are being delivered water weekly. However, this makes the people in those places dependent on that weekly shipment.

                           <li><b>Restoration.</b> Wells are being drilled into the ground in places that don't have water. This provides a new way for the people there to get water. 
                           </li>
                           <li><b>Treatment.</b> There are water treatment devices that can clean corrosive water, allowing people to use it again.

                           </li>
                           <li><b>Surface water.</b> Water is diverted from surface water areas such as lakes and rivers which is brought to people from aqueducts and canals.
