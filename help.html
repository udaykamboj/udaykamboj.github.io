                        <p>There are many ways you can help. One of those ways is by spreading awareness of water scarcity. You can use our game: Water is Wellness Platformer, to get people interested in our campaign. Another way to help is by supporting programs that fight against climate change. By stopping climate change, we can stop people from running out of water. Water scarcity is a growing problem due to the rising temperatures caused by climate change. By supporting programs that fight climate change, we can reduce the severity of water scarcity and help people access clean and safe drinking water. The Water is Wellness Platformer is a fun and engaging way to spread awareness of the issue and get people involved in the fight against climate change.</p>
