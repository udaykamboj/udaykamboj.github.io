                        <p>There are many ways you can help. One of those ways is by spreading awareness of water scarcity. You can use our game: Water is Wellness Platformer, to get people interested in our campaign. Another way to help is by supporting programs that fight against climate change. By stopping climate change, we can stop people from running out of water. Water scarcity is a growing problem due to the rising temperatures caused by climate change. By supporting programs that fight climate change, we can reduce the severity of water scarcity and help people access clean and safe drinking water. The Water is Wellness Platformer is a fun and engaging way to spread awareness of the issue and get people involved in the fight against climate change.</p>

                <div class="divider lg"></div>
                <p>The Water is Wellness campaign was started by a group of 7th graders. Their goal is to make a difference in challenging times. For example, all because of inflation and rates rising, many people can't afford everything, so that makes them into poverty and then they can't access clean water. Our goal is to make sure that everyone has clean, pure water. Think about the people that are undernourished and sick all over the world without water. Thus, we want to make sure that everyone has access to pure water, a bare necessity to human life.</p>
